# tensorflow-java-experiments

Experimenting with the TensorFlow 2.3 Java API.

## Usage

`python/` contains a Python script `create_models.py` that exports a few different toy TensorFlow
models.

`java/` contains a "Hello World" program (`src/main/java/HelloTensorFlow.java`) and a barebones
inference program (`src/main/java/SavedModelPredictor.java`). `java/README` contains commands
necessary to download the Java libraries.
